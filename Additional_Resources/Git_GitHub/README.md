This file contains all the information how to:
 Set up Git and GitHub and the basic commands to start working with these tools. We recommend to follow teh initiating workflow


It is recommended to start reading it via the order:
- setup_git_github.md
- Unix_shell
- 1_Git_and_GitHub.md
- 2_First_Git_Commands.md (2_First and 3_First are the same)
- 4_How_to_Track_Changes_Commit.md
- 5_Git_Commit_History.md
- 6_SSH_Keys

The  Workflow needed for TeamCoders:

**1) Form Teams** Partner with your friends or with people in the same time zone that you will be happy to work with
We try to make the collaboration more inclusive and diverse in background, and we would like to partner clinicians with engineers/physicists. 

**2)Follow git hands on practice**
**3) Set-up SSH Keys** 
**4) Clone the GitHub repository** from your Team Editor's GitHub account with the IDEAS Team Coder content.
**5) You are ready**to go and start collaboration!! **Find the Teams.md in your local repository file and write your name on it**.
**6) Then push it** to the Edotor's remote. BEWARE !! **DO NOT PUSH ALL AT THE SAME TIME** It will create a conflict
