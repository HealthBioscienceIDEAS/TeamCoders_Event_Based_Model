# Team Coders Project
 TeamCoders is a new project developed from a
partnership between [Health and Bioscience IDEAS](https://healthbioscienceideas.github.io)
and [UCL Clinician Coders](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/school-life-medical-sciences/about-slms/office-vice-provost-health/academic-careers-office/training-portfolios/clinician-coders#:~:text=Clinician%20Coders%20combines%20e%2Dlearning,academic%20and%20private%20sector%20partners.). 
Unlike a hackathon, the goal of this event is to create an inclusive, team building 
project involving code and biomedical research, bringing people from 
different background and coding skill levels to 
work together and quickly increase their coding skill.

## 1st Team Coder's Project
## Disease Progression Modelling with the Event Based Models

## Learning objectives
By the end of the project, attendees will be able to:
1. Understand the importance of medical imaging 
in extracting quantitative measures about the disease process in Alzheimer's disease and other related forms of dementia
2. Practice standard data cleaning and visualization techniques to interrogate and investigate the input data before analysis.
3. Learn how to implement the Event Based Model with an application to reproduce findings from a seminal paper. 
4. Further knowledge of the modelâ€™s outputs and utilize them for predicting future outcomes
 
## Prerequisites
 Please see the [Requirements page](requirements.md) for the required software skills.

 Please note that this course will be using the Python programming language and version control
 using git in order to track and synchronise each
 team's work.  If you are interested in attending this course or going through its content, then we would recommend:
* Basic familiarity with a scientific programming language, preferable Python or R.  
* Basic understanding of source code revision control using Git and Github.
If you have not experience with Git, dont't worry! There will be some demonstrations and support for helpers. You need to have a GitHub account! 

If you have experience with R and not Python, don't worry! Here are some helpful resources that you should look at before attending:
 
* [Python for R Users](https://github.com/poldrack/PythonForRUsers) - a helpful set of notebooks explaining various concepts in Python in the context of R users.
* Software Carpentry workshops - [Introductory courses in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) are available through [UCL Centre for Advanced Research Computing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/training/course-catalogue) and[Research Software London](https://rslondon.ac.uk/events/)

 
## Format
Team Coders events are currently organised as 
virtual, online events. We appreciate that 
everyone is quite busy, and when people are not 
on-site and able to concentrate the entire day 
on a learning activity, then daily like, work 
responsibilities and other distractions can take 
over. That is why we are opting for only a 
couple of sessions 2-3 hours long at the 
beginning and then allowing teams to select 
their own pace and the times most convenient for 
them to meet and discuss the project. We think 
that most teams should be able to finish the 
project over 2 to 3 weeks.

### Day 1 (Approximately 3 hours)
The first day will involve an informal warm-up 
session, so that the participants and 
facilitators can get to know each other a bit 
better, which will make interactions within the 
team and with the facilitators easier. Then there will be introductory lectures (3 hours) that will provide the background and concepts
that will be explored as part of this project:
* Imaging biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease
* Working with medical image data
* An overview of the Event Based Model

## Day 2 (Approximately 2 hours)
The next day will be a more interactive, hands-on 
session. We will create the teams and go over the 
working pattern for collaborating together on the 
project. Briefly, for each team session, one
team member will serve as _rapporteur_, meaning
that they will be typing the code as directed
by the other team members. At the end of the
session, the rapporteur will commit the changes
to their project repository, so that another
team member can sync these changes and take 
over as rapporteur in the next session. This
allows everyone the chance to participate.

## Days 3 onwards
 Now the real fun begins! We have set up three
 main tasks as part of the project:
 1. Extracting imaging biomarkers
 2. Data Cleaning and Wrangling
 3. Using the Event Based Model

 For each of these units, there is a _demonstration notebook_, where one of the 
 facilitators will go over
 a practical example of how to perform these
 tasks. There will also be a _project notebook_, 
 which will basically consist of some general
 instructions on what needs to be completed
 followed by a set of empty Python cells that
 must be completed. In some cases,  these project notebooks
 will build upon each other, so that the output
 from one notebook will be used as an input
 into the next notebook.
After the initial demonstration of the task is 
done by the facilitator, teams will meet on their 
own to work on the project. They will arrange 
routine _breifing sessions_ with the facilitator, 
where they will provide an update on their 
progress since the last meeting, what they plan to
do next, and what obstacles or challenges (if any)
are getting in their way to making progress. 

Once all three tasks are complete, each team
should replicate the results from the [original
EBM paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awu176) 
by Alexandra Young and colleagues.
 Time permitting, we will provide the opportunity 
 for the teams to try and meet additional challenges.
 
## End of project
We will have one final virtual session where each
team will present their work, what they learned
on the project, and how they think it will help
with their future research.
