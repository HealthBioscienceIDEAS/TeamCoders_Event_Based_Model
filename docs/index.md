# Team Coders Project
 TeamCoders is a new project developed from a
partnership between [Health and Bioscience IDEAS](https://healthbioscienceideas.github.io)
and [UCL Clinician Coders](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/school-life-medical-sciences/about-slms/office-vice-provost-health/academic-careers-office/training-portfolios/clinician-coders). 
Unlike a hackathon, the goal of this event is to create an inclusive, team building 
project involving code and biomedical research, bringing people from 
different background and coding skill levels to 
work together and quickly increase their coding skill.

## Disease Progression Modelling with the Event Based Models

## Learning objectives
By the end of the project, attendees will be able to:
1. Understand the importance of medical imaging in extracting quantitative measures about 
the disease process in Alzheimer's disease and other related forms of dementia
1. Practice standard data cleaning and visualization techniques to interrogate and investigate the input data before analysis.
1. Learn how to implement the Event Based Model with an application to reproduce findings from a seminal paper. 
1. Further knowledge of the modelâ€™s outputs and utilize them for predicting future outcomes
 
## Prerequisites
Please see the [Requirements page](requirements.md) for the required software skills.

Please note that this course will be using the Python programming language. 
If you are interested in attending this course or going through its content, then we would recommend you have a basic familiarity with a scientific programming language, preferable Python or R. Understanding source code revision control using Git/Github is optional if your team prefers to collaborate in this manner.  

If you have experience with R and not Python, don't worry! Here are some helpful resources that you should look at before attending:
* [Python for R Users](https://github.com/poldrack/PythonForRUsers) - a helpful set of notebooks explaining various concepts in Python in the context of R users.
* Software Carpentry workshops - [Introductory courses in Python](https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) are available through [UCL Centre for Advanced Research Computing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/advanced-research-computing/training/course-catalogue) and[Research Software London](https://rslondon.ac.uk/events/)

 
## Format
Team Coders events are currently organised as 
virtual, online events. They will have a few initial kickoff
sessions followed by teams working independently for the next couple of
days, followed by a final recap session at the end of the week. The project will run
for two weeks total.

### Week 1
#### Day 1 (Approximately 2-3 hours)
The first day will involve introductions, so that facilitators and participants can get to know each other a bit 
better, which will make interactions within the team and with the facilitators easier. 
Then there will be introductory lectures (3 hours) that will provide the background and concepts
that will be explored as part of this project:
* Imaging biomarkers in Alzheimer's disease
* An overview of the Event Based Model

#### Day 2 (Approximately 2-3 hours)
The next day will be a more interactive, hands-on session. We will create the teams and then make
sure everyone has their environments set up properly. Then we will start with a walkthrough of
the first task, which involves data cleaning and wrangling. One facilitator will go over the basic elements of this task. 
There is a _demonstration notebook_, where one of the facilitators will go over a practical example of how to perform these 
tasks. There will also be a _project notebook_, 
which will basically consist of some general
instructions on what needs to be completed
followed by a set of empty Python cells that
must be completed. In some cases,  these project notebooks
will build upon each other, so that the output
from the first project notebook will be used as an input for the second task.

#### Days 3-4
Teams will work together using the information they learned from the lectures and the 
information provided in the demonstration notebook to solve the challenge set up in the
project notebook. If needed, teams can arrange sessions with one of the facilitators, 
where they can discuss anything unclear or if they are stuck on a task. 

#### Day 5 (Approximately 1-2 hours)
This will be an online recap session, where all teams will discuss the progress they made on the first task notebook, what they
found easy, what they found difficult, and any additional things that they tried out.

### Week 2
#### Day 6 (Approximately 1-2 hours)
We will go through the second _demonstration notebook_, which is all about the Event Based Model.

#### Days 7-9
Teams will work together on the project notebook to replicate the results from the [original
EBM paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awu176) by Alexandra Young and colleagues. Time permitting, 
they will try to do additional tasks around this dataset. Again, teams are free to request sessions
with the facilitators to help them solve the task.

#### Day 10(Approximately 1-2 hours)
THis will be a final virtual session where each
team will present their work, what they learned
on the project, and how they think it will help
with their future research.
