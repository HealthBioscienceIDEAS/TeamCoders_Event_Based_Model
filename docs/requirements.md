# Requirements for this project
As we want to give all users the chance to 
run code as part of their team, we need to make
sure that the _development environment_ on each
user's machine is roughly the same. Please 
ensure that prior to the event the following has
been completed:
* Create a [github](https://github.com) account.
* Ensure that [git is installed](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) locally on the machine you are planning to use.
* Consider installing [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), a simple graphical interface for working with projects in git. If you don't have git installed already, GitHub Desktop should do that step for you.
* Ensure you have access to ADNI data. If you do not already have access to the ADNI data set, please visit their [Accessing data](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/) section to find out how to obtain access.
* Make sure that a recent version of Python (either using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)) is installed. We will use this to create a working environment that will install all the required packages and ensure that this project is kept separate from your regular work.
