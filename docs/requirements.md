# Requirements for this project
As we want to give all users the chance to 
run code as part of their team, we need to make
sure that the _development environment_ on each
user's machine is roughly the same. Please 
ensure that prior to the event the following has
been completed:
* Create a [github](https://github.com) account.
* Ensure that git is installed locally on the machine you are planning to use.
* Ensure you have access to ADNI data. If you do not already have access to the ADNI data set, please visit their [Accessing data](http://adni.loni.usc.edu/data-samples/access-data/) section to find out how to obtain access.

You are welcome to do the following steps before the event or during it. This is to setup the development environment that you will be working in:
* Make sure that a recent version of Python (either using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)) is installed.
* Create a conda environment called TeamCoders, which we will be using to keep this work separate from your regular work.
* Within this conda environment, ensure that it is setup with 
  * Python version 3.6 or higher
  * Support for Jupyter noteboks
  * [The KDE EBM package](https://github.com/ucl-pond/kde_ebm)
